R tutorial

The first R package tutorial to be included in the New Contributor's
guide is a **Walkthrough** added in the **Writing Bindings**
vignette. With time we will try to include additional tutorials
directly into this guide.

Writing Bindings Walkthrough
----------------------------

This tutorial will show how to do a binding of a C++ function
`starts_with() <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/compute.html#containment-tests>`_
to the (base) R function ``startsWith()``.

To view the tutorial follow the
`Walkthrough section of the Writing Bindings article <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/articles/developers/bindings.html#walkthrough>`_.
