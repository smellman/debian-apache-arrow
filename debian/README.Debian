TODO for Debian Arrow
---------------------

[X] Update Maintainer/Uploader in d/control
[ ] Update d/copyright
  [ ] Inquire with upstream what files are under the licenses in LICENSE.txt
[ ] Re-activate CUDA/Flight/Gandiva once dependencies in Debian are ready
[ ] Optional: clean out embedded code (not too much IIR)
